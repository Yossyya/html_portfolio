<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a recent graduate from the University Polithecnic of Durango with a degree
  in Software Engineering. I have a passion for web development and design, and
  I'm always looking to learn new skills and technologies. I have experience in
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and I'm currently learning React and
  Node.js. I'm also interested in UI/UX design and have a keen eye for detail.
  In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing videogames, and watching movies.
